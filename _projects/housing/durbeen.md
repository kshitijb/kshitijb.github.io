title: Durbeen - Developer-Designer Collaboration Tool
excerpt: Designer-developer Collaboration tool
category: Housing

At Housing Labs, we conceptualise, design, develop and ship products. Durbeen was my first project at Housing Labs. I formed a team consisting of a UI Designer and a web frontend developer and I took the charge of the product in every possible sense.

Durbeen is a communication tool for product teams working across different products in an organisation. It brings visibility in progress status and product critique across the organisation. Hence, problems like following are easily resolved.

- Lack of coherence among different products under an organization is easily tackled.
- Project progress is tangible
- Easy sharing of assets between developers and designers.
