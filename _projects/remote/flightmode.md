title: Flightmode - Quality Journalism in a calm environment
excerpt: A thoughtful media app which gives at max 3 articles a day. No breaking news!
category: Remote
---
**Client**: [Flightmode](https://getflightmode.com)  
**Deliverable**: iOS App, Admin Dashboard, Algorithm  
**Status**: In Progress

Flightmode is an app that provides a calm environment for you to read quality journalism. It recreates that old newspaper feeling digitally. It gives you 3 daily articles curated by intelligent people. The intention is for these articles to trigger reflection. No constant updates, no endless scrolling, no noise. You can think of Flightmode as a tool that helps you create healthier, more enjoyable habits around media. A tool that lets you trade quick news updates for slower reflection.  
More on the philosophy of the app can be [read here](https://medium.com/getflightmode/lets-change-our-news-consumption-9e8a52408e87).

I am working closely with the founders of the startup for public release of Flightmode V1.
