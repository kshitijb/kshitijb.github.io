99.co is a [Sequoia Capital and Eduardo Saverin funded](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/99-co) startup based out of Singapore. It is a powerful map-based property search engine that utilizes smart algorithms to provide housing renters, buyers, and property agents alike a fast, transparent, and efficient property search experience. To meet the demand, 99.co wanted to build a platform where real estate developers can manage showcase and sales of their multi storied projects.

The web app was designed to cater to the needs of 3 essential components of real estate eco-system in Singapore -
1. Real Estate Developers
2. Sales Coordinators
3. Sales Agents

The core of the application is to enable a workflow which allows real estate developers to list their properties, manage inventory and real time sales visibility. The sales coordinators and agents would facilitate sales of inventory for which they would be compensated in brokerage fee.
