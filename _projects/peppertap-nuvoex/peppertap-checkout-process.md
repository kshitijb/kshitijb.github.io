<h1 class="heading">Objective</h1>
1. `PROBLEM 1`: Decrease Cash On Delivery orders
2. `PROBLEM 2`: Decrease order cancellation because of faulty payment mode
3. `PROBLEM 3`: Make payment offers more visible to users

<h1 class="heading">Hypothesis</h1>
1. `PROBLEM 1` can be attributed to the `Delivery Details` screen preselecting Cash on delivery as the payment mode for all the users which contributes to higher percentage of COD orders
2. `PROBLEM 2` can be attributed to the fact that users were cancelling orders because they wanted to pay via online methods but `missed` that option
3. `PROBLEM 3` 

<h1 class="heading">Solution</h1>
- The system was modified to leverage user preference for a payment mode and the design made the payment mode selection apparent with the default payment mode preselected instead of COD. Solution to the `PROBLEM 1 and 2` can be found in the screens below

- The offers were scattered across screens on the app. The solution collated all the payment options and made offer discovery an optional flow in the checkout process. Solution to the `PROBLEM 3` can be found in the screens below.
