**WHO**  
I am Kshitij, a product manager who has a [formal education in design](https://www.iitg.ernet.in/design/){:target='_blank_'} from [1 of the top 7 technology institutes of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology#History){:target='_blank_'}. I am a self-taught full-stack developer. I have gained {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus:2012 }} years of professional experience which has honed my skills to empathize better with stakeholders, be it a user or a business team, while keeping a sharp eye on business opportunities. I am a DIY and lean working style enthusiast. Once in a while, I indulge in new experiences to expand my perspective about the biosphere and life in general.

**HOW I GOT INTO FULLTIME PRODUCT MANAGEMENT**  
I started my professional career with an Indian e-commerce unicorn, [Flipkart](https://flipkart.com){:target='_blank_'}, as an interaction designer. Designing interactions and systems for a scale of millions of users per day helped structuring my thought process and trained me in product development cycle management. Utilizing this experience in a relatively small VC funded startup ([Touchtalent](http://touchtalent.com){:target='_blank_'}, now [Bobbleapp](http://bobbleapp.me){:target='_blank_'}) as their 4th employee, I set up the product development culture and process. The confidence of managing a product development in entirety landed me up as a Lead in the Innovation Group at [Housing.com](https://housing.com){:target='_blank_'}. I lead development and launch of 2 products from scratch in a lean working team. This is when I realized that I could churn out better products in more quantity as an enabler. I joined India's [fastest growing e-Grocery startup, Peppertap](https://yourstory.com/2015/12/peppertap-series-b-funding-acquires-jiffstore/){:target='_blank_'}, as a Product Manager and have been shaping products and product strategies since then at the parent company, [Nuvo Logistics](http://nuvoex.com){:target='_blank_'}.

**REMOTE WORK**  
The remote working notion has always interested me. With the remote work trend catching up, I started experimenting with my time utilization. Having freelanced for startups from Netherlands, Singapore and Sweden as a Product Manager, I have started to like this mode of working.
