I received formal education in design at Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IIT G). I consider ability to empathise with users as my most valuable skill. And with amalgamation of technical skills, I'm equipped to solve their problems by designing scalable systems with great experiences. A knack for logical reasoning and data analysis has been monumental in shaping me as a designer.

Starting off my professional career with Flipkart (Flipkart was a startup back then!) and experiencing subtleties of product development cycle inspired me to continue with product function of business. Then, a stint at an early stage startup, Touchtalent, groomed me and brought out my ability to adapt to any function of the business. Currently, I'm setting up Housing Labs which is the innovation powerhouse of Housing.com

Formally educated in design and engineer by choice, I can single handedly conceptualise products and ship them. I've been coding since school times. Over the period, I've developed full stack development skills too in order to have better control over a product.


As a product manager who has a formal education in design from 1 of the top 7 technology institutes of India and an intermediate full-stack development skill, I believe I can do justice to the role you are recruiting for. I had started my professional career with Indian unicorn, Flipkart, as an interaction designer. During the experience, I learnt and assessed that product management needs people with an ingrained design attitude and product understanding which led me to transition into Product Management full-time. Learning new skills come naturally to me. Over time I acquired full stack development skills as and when I felt the need for projects I worked on. I value the effectiveness and efficiency of a communication as an integral skill for a product manager be it day-to-day messages or product requirement documents. All of these skills tied together help me function in a fast and lean mode.

In addition, The remote working notion has always interested me. And in the past 1 year, I had opportunities to freelance with startups from Netherlands, Singapore and Sweden as a Product Manager. The invaluable learnings from this experience made me realise that I am more productive with my time in such a setup.
