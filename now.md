# What am I doing now

Updated on _29th April 2017_
<br/><br/>
I am hooked to the concept of remote work. Since last year, I have been spending substantial time working on remote projects, managing remote development teams distributed across countries.

1. Managing product development of [Flightmode](http://getflightmode.com/){:target="_blank_"}, a thoughtful media app that is factful, brings you a different point of view. Not more than 3 articles a day. It is a Swedish startup.
2. Senior Product Manager at [NuvoEx](http://www.nuvoex.com){:target="_blank_"}. Enabling logistics transactions for e-commerce companies like [Flipkart](https://flipkart.com){:target='_blank_'}, [Myntra](https://myntra.com){:target='_blank_'}, [PayTM](https://paytm.com){:target='_blank_'}, [Shopclues](https://shopclues.com){:target='_blank_'}, [Snapdeal](https://snapdeal.com){:target='_blank_'}.
3. Working on a side project which would help in technical analysis of securities in the Indian stock markets.
4. Binging on [Amazon Prime Video](https://primevideo.com){:target="_blank_"} while commuting.
5. Reading [Value Proposition Design](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B06X429CJH/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3638&creative=24630&creativeASIN=B06X429CJH&linkCode=as2&tag=savemoney0dd-21&linkId=949e43d3a24bdb805eca1b2837d7e898){:target="_blank_"}
