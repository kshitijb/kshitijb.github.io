# What I'm involved in now

Updated on **{{site.time | date: '%-d %B %Y'}}**

I am hooked to the concept of remote work. Since last year, I have been spending substantial time working on remote projects, managing remote development teams.

1. Freelancing for [Flightmode](http://getflightmode.com/){:target="_blank"}, a thoughtful media app that is factful, brings you a different point of view. Not more than 3 articles a day. It is a Swedish startup.
2. Senior Product Manager at [NuvoEx](http://www.nuvoex.com){:target="_blank"} by day.
3. Working on a project which would help in technical analysis through an often overlooked volume indicator while shortlisting stocks in the Indian stock markets.
4. Binging on [Amazon Prime](https://primevideo.com){:target="_blank"} while commuting.
5. Reading [Value Proposition Design](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B06X429CJH/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3638&creative=24630&creativeASIN=B06X429CJH&linkCode=as2&tag=savemoney0dd-21&linkId=949e43d3a24bdb805eca1b2837d7e898){:target="_blank"}
