# What am I doing now

Updated on _17th August 2017_
<br/><br/>
I am hooked to the concept of remote work. Since last year, I have been spending substantial time working on remote projects, managing remote development teams distributed across countries.

1. Managing product development of [Flightmode](http://getflightmode.com/){:target="_blank_"}, a thoughtful media app that is factful, brings you a different point of view. Not more than 3 articles a day. It is a Swedish startup.

This page is inspired from [Now Page](http://nownownow.com/about) and summarizes my current focus.
