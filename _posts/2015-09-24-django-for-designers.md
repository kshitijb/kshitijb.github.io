### Why Django?  

We designers often not associate ourselves with the technicalities of a product that we are designing, which is good in the designing mode. But I believe that a designer should also know how a product is built to a greater degree if not developing himself. Especially who like to work in a startup environment.

This philosophy got me started in learning full-stack development skills. Although I got good in web frontend during my design education (assignments) I always lacked a backend skill. Backend being the pillar of dynamic content delivery and scaling up, is an essential stack in product development. So, I researched about easy to learn and efficient frameworks to get started. Python-Django and Ruby on Rails were obvious to shortlist. I tried both initially and then decided to go with Python-Django (I somehow liked the simplicity of the syntax and the intense Django documentation). But Django is not a REST framework, so my To-Learn list got extended. I had to pick up Django Rest Framework (DRF) too which is a toolkit to build REST APIs using Django’s ORM.

I’ve never seen any documentation as detailed as Django’s. This definitely helped me get past the initial Getting Started Death Zone which usually has a higher fatality as compared with other frameworks. The best part was that the Django+DRF tutorials were designed in such a way that I got started asap.

But then came hiccups which made me realize that whatever had been learned was nothing. I took the bait and got onboard. I even had an occasional feeling of being stuck with Django too. But being persistent and determined to learn backend, I had to struggle with this feeling for a few days. Reading Stackoverflow and Googling doubts had become my routine for those days. And then I had a Pseudo AHA! moment.

I got confident enough to build my REST APIs. And I started investing time in coding up an idea. This is when I met with some advanced Django Stuff and had to unlearn the bits and pieces understanding of Django to have a systematic understanding. The Real AHA! moment struck me during this phase.

I can now code any complex application and make my products.
This whole experience had been amazing because it tested my persistence and determination level. My key suggestions for any newbie would be to -  
1. Never lose faith in yourself
2. Trust in Stackoverflow and Google
3. Having a backend skill is a good addition to skillset
