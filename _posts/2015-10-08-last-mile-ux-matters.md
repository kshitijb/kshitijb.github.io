Almost all the e-commerce companies are going the marketplace model way. Scalability is the primary reason for a business to do so. But there is another unstated (probably unadmitted) reason which leverages non-responsibility of such a business for the quality of product or service being offered. This is the cruel and vicious side of e-commerce platforms. No one wants to take responsibility of a bad job but never lags behind in taking full credit of a good one. Being a marketplace, legally it’s easy for companies to shrug a blame off onto a seller and move on. Morally and ethically they should be responsible for any bad experience. We’ve all been hearing about such cases across online services be it Uber, Flipkart, Paytm etc.

> Products which fail to deliver an amazing last mile UX, occasionally turn user’s experience into a nightmare.

I’m sharing my recent experiences with 2 of the famous e-commerce platforms.

**Redbus**  
I had to book some tickets urgently just a few hours before the travel. I chose to go with Redbus having heard a lot about it. This was my first experience of using Redbus. Discovery and filtering of buses were pleasantly easy. But shortlisting was horrible. There wasn’t enough information from authenticated sources about the quality, experience and route specific alerts. I had to take a leap of faith and booked the tickets with a service provider. This decision turned out to be the worst decision in my recent past.
First, this service provider turned out to be just an agent who had hired a few “freelance” bus drivers and conductors to make a profit from a seasonal demand. Hence, it had no experience of the route and lacked sincerity.

Second, the bus took at least “twice” as much time as it should have. Just imagine sitting in a bus for 24 hours that too on a mountainous road. This happened partly because of a high season demand and majorly because of lack of familiarity of the driver-conductor duo with the route.

Had I known this information beforehand, I would have opted for another mode of transport. I couldn’t do anything about it except cancelling the return ticket.

**PayTm**  
Same scenario on a different day. I reached home after a late night flight. Somehow managed a sleep of 4–5 hours before getting up at 5:30 in the morning. This time, I chose to use PayTm to book my last minute bus ticket. Surprisingly there were buses leaving in a couple of hours at the time I checked the availability on PayTm. Being in a hurry, I chose the earliest available bus and booked it. I received the confirmation message and all sorts of information from PayTm in a few minutes after booking. This was very quick and I was surprised at the ease of booking. I didn’t know that this good surprise was going to turn into a bad nightmare soon. Right after booking, I called the bus service provider to confirm the ticket just to be sure. The person asked me to forward the booking SMS and wait for some time. As the pickup time was approaching, I picked up my stuff and left for the pickup location. I reached at the location 15 minutes before the stipulated time just to be sure to not give the bus driver an excuse to leave me stranded. But to my shock, when I called the service provider again after reaching at the bus stop about the status, he blatantly said that the bus was not operating that day. I was completely startled with this unexpected response. But as it was urgent for me to leave, I managed to book another bus service after waiting for an hour at the pickup location.

Having been sleep deprived and stranded at the pickup location, I decided to take up this issue with PayTm. So, I wrote them about the incidence and asked for their reply. To my further dismay, PayTm replied that it was my fault as I had not reached the pickup location in time and they even refused to refund the bus ticket fare. This is when I completely lost trust in PayTm.

They didn’t even bother to check with their service provider who, surprisingly, maintained that the bus wasn’t operating that day even after knowing that he would have to refund the ticket amount. The bus service provider was my only hope as there wasn’t a way to present the call I had with him as a proof.

I continued my battle with PayTm over the issue which continued over a month and furnished them proofs of the fault at their and the service provider’s end. And finally won it. But the worst part was that one of their product managers called and told me that I was lying!
Conclusion

Both these bad experiences have a common cause. The apathy of the company after sales. Both the above-mentioned companies lack requisite information to make a right decision, a system to check a provider’s service quality and a system to check real-time service statuses.

I hope that the startups will take the after-sales experience seriously and start being accountable for such experiences.

> Last mile UX is what going to differentiate a startup from the plethora of similar services.
